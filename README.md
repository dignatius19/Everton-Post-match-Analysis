# Everton Post-match Analysis
Post-match video analysis on Everton's chance creation

# Motivation
- This project was part of my recent United Soccer Coaches Performance Analysis Level-2 course. In this project, I examined Everton's chance creation for the first 60 minutes against Millonarios. This report was meant to be a basic post-match stats report presented to the players or coaching staff.
